## Translating methods, interfaces and structural subtyping 

Recall the “run-time method look up” (RT) and “dictionary-translation” (DT) approach covered here

1. Compare the run-time performance of RT and DT (e.g. call “sumArea” in a loop and measure which version runs faster)

2. Apply the RT and DT approach to one further example of your own choice.

3. Extend RT and DT to deal with type assertions. See example below.

4. Extend RT and DT to deal with type bounds. See example below.

5. Summarize your findings in a short document (you could set up a github repo).
